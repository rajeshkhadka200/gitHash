# GitHash 


## Overview

Introducing GitHash - a powerful open-source web application that seamlessly converts your GitHub commits into engaging Hashnode articles. GitHash goes beyond GitHub actions; it's a complete web application with a user-friendly UI dashboard, giving you control over configurations and updates to uniquely showcase your work.

## Project Introduction 🙋‍♂️

GitHash, licensed under MIT, utilizes GitHub actions and the GitHub API to effortlessly publish articles on Hashnode. Share detailed insights into your latest GitHub commits, highlighting changes, file modifications, and showcasing code modifications.

## Features ⚙

- **Configurable Markdown:** Customize and publish your markdown structure (markdown.md) after each repository push.

- **Skip Publishing Option:** Use the commit message "avoid publish" to skip article publishing while pushing code to the repository.

- **Custom Markdown:** Include a markdown[.]md file in the root of the repository and add the phrase "my md" in the commit message to publish your custom markdown.

- **Dashboard:** Track publishing processes, manage Hashnode credentials, view tracked repositories, and access published blog posts.
